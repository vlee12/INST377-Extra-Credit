Please write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a website that will list out the building names and markers on a map containing the building locations based on a filter from an input box and radio buttons. The API is https://api.umd.io/v1/map/buildings.

Please replace the google maps API with https://leafletjs.com/ maps feature

Please include a filter button with the features of filtering out the data based on the input box or the radio buttons consisting of residence, dining, library, sports, and parking

Please use the latest version of leaflet.js

The leaflet.js version should be 1.9.3

Please center the graph to College Park, MD

This error popped up: tLng.js:32 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Invalid LatLng object: (38.992006368432, undefined)

The filter button is not working

Please change the radio buttons value to residence, dining, library, sports, and parking

Please list out the building names based on the filter

The filter button does not work and nothing is being displayed when I rpess the filter button

Please remove the markers feature

The input box filters correctly but the radio buttons do not filter. This is the error: caught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLowerCase') script.js:42

The radio buttons are still not filtering correctly, there are no errors that result

There should be no building category, the filtered list should contain building names with the filterValue in them

Please uncheck all radio buttons when an input is being type out

Do not filter the list until the complete word is typed and the filter button is pressed

Please add these features: -Using localStorage, load your data into a collection that saves itself to the browser.
-Make sure your filter methods are filtering that data set and not a fresh one every time the page loads.
-Add a form control to really refresh the page. Add a button you can click to do an API call that will swap out the localStorage for something new.

I have an error saying data is not defined

for the refresh button add event listener, it says "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener') script.js:52"

Please clear the input box when a radio button is selected

Allow the refresh button to work at anytime

The refresh button should clear the existing localstorage and call in a new dataset with no filters from the API

the filter button does not work properly anymore when selecting radio button options

Update the CSS to have the map and the buildings list side by side

please update the HTML accordingly

Please update the above HTML with the corresponding containers in the CSS
